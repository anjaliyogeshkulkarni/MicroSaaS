### StrategyFlow
A low-code platform (called **Emergent 021**) combining systems thinking and AI agents for modeling complex business systems, enabling organizations to visualize, simulate, and optimize strategic decisions through intelligent workflow graphs. 

### Emergent 021
- **Emergent:** Reflecting the idea of unlocking hidden potential from interconnected systems and leveraging emergent properties.
- **021 (Zero to One):** A symbolic representation of disruptive innovation, aiming for a quantum leap rather than incremental change.

## Vision
The mission is to consult individuals and organizations using mastery over systems thinking‚Äîa portable language to model, analyze, and solve problems across any domain. 

### Problem Statement
The modern world is rife with complexity, and most individuals and teams lack the tools and frameworks to understand or solve systemic problems effectively. Traditional methods are fragmented, hard to master, and often domain-specific.

### Our Solution
To provide an open-source, GUI-based, low-code tool designed to simplify systems thinking, systems engineering, and strategy modeling. This platform enables users to visually construct, simulate, and refine mental models of their problems or situations across various domains.

### Key Features
1. **Strategy Modeling Made Easy**: A visual, intuitive interface that democratizes systems thinking and modeling.
2. **Specific Knowledge Encoded**: Incorporates principles from PySD, SysML, Stellar, Vensim, and ancient texts like Nyay Shastra and Yogasutra‚Äîcoded into system language for modern problem-solving.
3. **Personalized Coaching**: 1:1 coaching sessions tailored to INFJs, leveraging their unique ability to grasp complex emotional and systemic dynamics rapidly.
4. **AI Agents Integration**: Utilize AI agents to automate repetitive tasks and generate insights from models.
5. **Universal Applicability**: A toolset that transcends industries, from healthcare and finance to education and governance.
6. **Open-Source Advantage**: Community-driven innovation ensures accessibility and continuous improvement.
