## Possible MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Education: Personalized Learning Pathways
- Problem: Traditional education systems don't adapt to individual learning styles or needs.
- Solution: Use graph models to represent learning paths and AI agents to guide students based on their progress, preferences, and goals.
- PoC/MVP: A tool for creating custom learning paths in a specific subject (e.g., programming basics), using graph-based progression maps.
