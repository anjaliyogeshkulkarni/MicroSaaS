# Systems Consultancy

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to **System Thinking and Dynamics**, a field focused on understanding and modeling complex systems through simulation and feedback analysis. The primary aim is to enhance decision-making in various domains by providing tools and methodologies that capture the dynamic behavior of systems over time.

**System Dynamics** (SD) is a methodology for understanding the nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time. It employs stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, and time delays to model dynamic interactions within systems. Originally developed in the 1950s for corporate management, it now finds applications across various sectors including public policy, healthcare, and environmental studies[1][3][5].

## Quotes 
- System is more than sum of its parts. 
- Non-linear Thinking
- Playing the game changes the rules (based on stock, logic may change).

## Key Concepts
- **Feedback Loops**: Chains of cause-and-effect relationships that influence system behavior.
- **Stocks and Flows**: Represent accumulations (stocks) and changes (flows) within a system.
- **Modeling and Simulation**: Using computational tools to simulate system behavior under different scenarios.
- **Policy Design**: Utilizing insights gained from models to inform decision-making and strategy development[1][5].

## System Dynamics Approach
- Dynamics Thinking (Graph over time)
- Causal thinking (feedback loops)
- Stock and flow thinking (accumulations)
- Thinking endogenously (system as cause)


## Installation
To get started with System Dynamics modeling, you may need specific software tools. Below are some popular options:
- **Vensim**: A powerful tool for building SD models.
- **Stella Architect**: User-friendly software for creating dynamic models.
- **AnyLogic**: A versatile simulation software that supports SD modeling.

Installation instructions vary by software; please refer to the respective documentation for details.

## Usage
1. **Define the Problem**: Identify the key issues you want to address within your system.
2. **Map the System**: Create a causal loop diagram to visualize feedback loops and interactions.
3. **Build the Model**: Use simulation software to quantify relationships between variables.
4. **Run Simulations**: Test different scenarios to observe potential outcomes.
5. **Analyze Results**: Use findings to inform decision-making and policy design.

	1. Emergence occurs when something fundamentally new arises that wasn't present before, such as a living cell emerging from non-living molecules, representing a scientifically admissible form of "magic."

	2. Synergy and emergence are paired concepts - synergy creates wholes greater than the sum of their parts, while emergence describes the new properties that arise from these synergistic relationships.

	3. All emergence stems from attractive forces, both physical (gravity, electromagnetism) and metaphysical (love, shared purpose), which Buckminster Fuller called "metaphysical gravity."

	4. Emergence requires elegant ordered complexity, not just random combination - components must be arranged in specific patterns to create meaningful emergent properties.

	5. More interesting synergies emerge from combining different elements rather than similar ones, exemplified by how hydrogen and oxygen combine to create water with entirely new properties.

	6. Evolution selects for systems that exhibit the most advantageous emergent properties, driving both increasing diversity and more sophisticated unification across differences.

	7. The evolutionary universe moves toward more elegant ordered complexity without requiring a creator, operating through self-organizing principles rather than random probability.

	8. Consciousness evolution progresses through increasingly complex nervous systems, from reptilian (pain/pleasure) to prefrontal cortex (abstraction and planning).

	9. Human abstract thinking allows us to understand deep past and future, making us unique in our ability to consciously participate in evolution.

	10. Every individual represents a unique facet of universal evolution, offering something that no one else can contribute exactly the same way.

	11. Competition becomes an obsolete concept when we understand that universal evolution moves toward greater differentiation and symbiosis across novelty.

	12. Current global systems are experiencing simultaneous exponential improvements and degradation, indicating an approaching phase shift rather than linear progression.

	13. Future social systems must align individual incentives with collective well-being, moving from differential advantage to systemic advantage for the whole.

	14. Infrastructure must shift from linear materials economy (extract-use-waste) to closed-loop systems that maintain progressively higher quality of life sustainably.

	15. Modern challenges are inherently global, requiring coordinated solutions across all nations and peoples, as local problems have become extinct in our interconnected world.

	16. Success for any individual cannot be meaningfully separated from the success of the whole system, given our fundamental interconnectedness.

	17. Humans can now consciously choose how to participate in evolution, moving from being passive participants to active creators of future emergence.

  - [Complex Systems Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-CSs1UEbFQ)
	- Modeling based approach.
	- Finding order/patterns in random event, e.g. bird flock. 
	- Underlying structure. e.g. Power Law
	- Complex systems are more about interactions than components
	- Newtonian Thinking: 
		- Equilibrium, 
		- Deterministic, 
		- Causal (linear), 
		- Reductionist 
		- "System is Sum of Parts"
	- How to deal with complex systems: 
		- Agent based modeling (Good for understandings but not for prediction): define agents and interactions, put them in the field and see what macro picture emerges. E.g. NetLogo, Game of Life
		- Machine Learning (better for Prediction not understanding)
	- Systems Thinking: 
		- Emergence (what was not programmed for), 
		- Self-organization, 
		- Edge of chaos (butterfly effect)
		- Feedback loops
		- "System is more than Sum of Parts"

	- Gaphor/SysML: Open-source, Multi-platform, Python for Systems Engineering
	- Too many input variables, combinations, using MBSE (Model based System Engineering) ie Common language, Abstraction (Levels: Concept, Logical, Technology, Implementation), Automation: SysML (Systems Modeling Language)
	- More like User Activity Graphical modeling, like UML
