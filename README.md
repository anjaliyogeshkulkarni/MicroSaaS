# MicroSaaS: Emergent Approach to Strategic Innovation

## 🎯 Executive Summary
Position as a coach and thought leader in a pioneering a transformative approach to strategic innovation through a **MicroSaaS** methodology focused on unlocking hidden potential. **Not Looking for Success but for Wonder!!**

### MicroSaaS Principles
- **Micro**: Emphasizing solo or small team dynamics
- **SaaS**: Strategy AI Agents Systems | Software As A Service approach

### Core Philosophy: Emergent 021
- **Emergent:** Unlocking potential from interconnected systems
- **021 (Zero to One):** Symbolic representation of disruptive innovation

### Prominent Theme: Systems & Graphs with AI

**Systems are everywhere!** 🌍🔗 From biology and physics to mathematics and software—everything operates within a system. (see *Thinking in Systems* by Donella Meadows. 📖)  

A system is essentially a **set of interconnected elements with a function or purpose**. But here’s the catch—systems are more than just the sum of their parts! (Think *2+2=5* 🤯). With feedback loops and self-organization, they create emergent behaviors that are often unpredictable.  

One powerful way to represent systems? **Graphs!** 📊  

Graphs are everywhere—social networks, molecular structures, geometric shapes, and more. But what happens when we take graphs a step further? **Knowledge Graphs** bring us even closer to modeling reality, unlocking new AI possibilities. 🚀  

Here’s what I’m currently exploring in this space:  
✅ **Graph RAG** – Retrieving relational contexts beyond similarity, building a [chatbot](https://github.com/yogeshhk/Sarvadnya/tree/master/src/ask_yogasutra) on Indic wisdom 📜🤖 
✅ **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** – Learning embeddings for predictions/classifications, a consulting project, presentations [here](https://github.com/yogeshhk/TeachingDataScience)  
✅ **Geometric Deep Learning** – Developing invariant representations for tasks like dimensionality reduction - [MidcurveNN](https://github.com/yogeshhk/MidcurveNN)  
✅ **Graph-based Agents** – Automating workflows with intelligent agents, potential MicroSaaS idea 💡, that's [here](https://github.com/yogeshhk/MicroSaaS/tree/master/src/qa_agent)
