# Systems Thinking and Dynamics

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to **System Thinking and Dynamics**, a field focused on understanding and modeling complex systems through simulation and feedback analysis. The primary aim is to enhance decision-making in various domains by providing tools and methodologies that capture the dynamic behavior of systems over time.


## Installation
To get started with System Dynamics modeling, you may need specific software tools. Below are some popular options:
- **Vensim**: A powerful tool for building SD models.
- **Stella Architect**: User-friendly software for creating dynamic models.
- **AnyLogic**: A versatile simulation software that supports SD modeling.

Installation instructions vary by software; please refer to the respective documentation for details.

## Usage
1. **Define the Problem**: Identify the key issues you want to address within your system.
2. **Map the System**: Create a causal loop diagram to visualize feedback loops and interactions.
3. **Build the Model**: Use simulation software to quantify relationships between variables.
4. **Run Simulations**: Test different scenarios to observe potential outcomes.
5. **Analyze Results**: Use findings to inform decision-making and policy design.

	- Modeling based approach.
	- Finding order/patterns in random event, e.g. bird flock. 
	- Underlying structure. e.g. Power Law
	- Complex systems are more about interactions than components
	- Newtonian Thinking: 
		- Equilibrium, 
		- Deterministic, 
		- Causal (linear), 
		- Reductionist 
		- "System is Sum of Parts"
	- How to deal with complex systems: 
		- Agent based modeling (Good for understandings but not for prediction): define agents and interactions, put them in the field and see what macro picture emerges. E.g. NetLogo, Game of Life
		- Machine Learning (better for Prediction not understanding)
	- Systems Thinking: 
		- Emergence (what was not programmed for), 
		- Self-organization, 
		- Edge of chaos (butterfly effect)
		- Feedback loops
		- "System is more than Sum of Parts"

	- Gaphor/SysML: Open-source, Multi-platform, Python for Systems Engineering
	- Too many input variables, combinations, using MBSE (Model based System Engineering) ie Common language, Abstraction (Levels: Concept, Logical, Technology, Implementation), Automation: SysML (Systems Modeling Language)
	- More like User Activity Graphical modeling, like UML
